	\section{Background Layer}
		Each background is composed of several layers. Each layer has it's own properties. There are some types of background layers:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{ColorBackgroundLayer: } A simple layer that fills the screen with a solid color;
		\item \textbf{ImageBackGroundLayer: } A layer that fills the screen with a image. The image can be stretched to fill the screen or can be tiled horizontally, vertically or in both directions.
		\end{itemize}
