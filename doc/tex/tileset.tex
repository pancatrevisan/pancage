	\section{Introduction}
		The tileset is a set of \emph{Tiles}. Each Tileset is built using an image. This image is divided into a set of subimages, each of this subimage is a \emph{Tile}. All Tiles in a tileset are square and have the same size (pixels).
	
	
	\section{Tile}
		Each tile of a Tileset as attributes one image (java.awt.Image) and informations about wich directions the player and enemies can pass in this tile, as shows Figure \ref{fig:tile}.

	\section{Tileset}
		A tileset is a set of tiles. An image is loaded and a tile size is set. The image of Tileset is cut into as many as possible Tiles. This set of tiles are used to create an Scenary. Figure \ref{fig:tileset} shows an tileset example.

	\section{File Format}
		The tileset can be saved to a file. It is written in binary format, and the format is shown in Listing \ref{listing-tilesetFormat}.
